Can't be scared to add seasonings and really drench it with egg, flour, and bread crumbs.<br>
 I like to get it it started in a cast iron, drain the oil, and then toss in the oven. <br>
 Then be liberal with cheese. Very liberal.</p>

<h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
<p>Sarma in somerville is pricey but the food is incredible. <br>
Everything I have tried on the menu has been delicious and different. <br>
The food is elevated but not pretentious.</p>
